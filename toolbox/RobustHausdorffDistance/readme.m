% This code implements a robust Hausdorff distance (RHD), which computes the
% distance between pairs of point sets. RHD has the ability to effectively
% deal with noise and outliers in the data.
% The corresponding paper for this codes has been submitted to the Journal
% of Pattern Recognition Letters for consideration.
